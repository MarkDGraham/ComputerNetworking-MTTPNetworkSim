# Multipacket Transfer Protocol (MTTP) Simulation

This project simulates **packet transfer over a network** using a custom **Multipacket Transfer Protocol (MTTP)** model.  
It combines **Python** for network generation, visualization, and k-shortest path calculations, with **C++** for path analysis, TCP/UDP timing calculations, and probability of failure analysis.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Python Network Generation (`driver.py`)**  
   - Generates a random network graph with a specified number of nodes using **NetworkX**.  
   - Assigns **random weights** to edges (simulating transfer times in ms).  
   - Computes **k-shortest paths** from a start node to an end node.  
   - Saves the network edges and path data to `output.txt`.

2. **C++ Path Analysis (`driver.cpp`)**  
   - Reads `output.txt` for network edges and k-shortest paths.  
   - For each path:  
     - Calculates **UDP transmission time** as the sum of edge weights.  
     - Calculates **TCP transmission time** as UDP + 3 ms per node.  
     - Tracks **probability of failure** for each path.  
   - Computes **combined failure probabilities** for all path combinations.  
   - Outputs results to `pathAnalysis.txt`.

3. **Output Visualization**  
   - Python generates a **network plot** showing nodes and edge weights (requires `matplotlib`).  
   - C++ outputs a **text-based analysis** including:  
     - Path sequences  
     - UDP/TCP times  
     - Failure probabilities  
     - Combined failure probabilities for path sets

## 📝 Steps to Run the Simulation

Follow these steps to generate a network, compute paths, and analyze them:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.

2. Run the Python script `driver.py` to generate a random network:  
   - This will create a network graph with labeled nodes and random edge weights.  
   - The script will compute k-shortest paths from the start node to the end node.  
   - Results are saved automatically to `output.txt`.

3. Compile the C++ program `driver.cpp`:  
   - This will create an executable (e.g., `pathAnalysis`) that reads `output.txt`.

4. Run the C++ executable:  
   - The program calculates UDP and TCP times for each path.  
   - It also computes failure probabilities for each path and all path combinations.  
   - Results are saved to `pathAnalysis.txt`.

5. View the results in `pathAnalysis.txt`:  
   - Each path with nodes is listed along with UDP/TCP times.  
   - Individual and combined path failure probabilities are included.

6. Optional edits:  
   - Modify `driver.py` to change the number of nodes, probability of edges, or random seed.  
   - Modify `driver.cpp` to adjust TCP/UDP calculation parameters or failure probability logic.

## 🔧 Extending the Simulation

- Change the number of nodes or probability of edges in Python (`generate_network`) to simulate different networks.  
- Adjust edge weight ranges to model different latency distributions.  
- Extend `driver.cpp` to simulate additional protocols or more complex failure models.  
- Enhance Python visualization with color-coded edges for high-latency links or failing paths.
